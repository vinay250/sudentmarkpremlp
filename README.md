Explanation:

data/: This directory contains subdirectories for different types of data. Raw data is stored in the raw/ directory, processed data in the processed/ directory, and so on.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks are organized based on their purpose. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks are in exploratory/, preprocessing notebooks in preprocessing/, and modeling notebooks in modeling/.

src/: This directory contains Python scripts organized by functionality. The data/ directory may include scripts for loading and processing data, features/ for feature engineering, models/ for defining and training machine learning models, and evaluation/ for model evaluation scripts.

tests/: Unit tests for the code in the src/ directory.

config/: Configuration files for model hyperparameters, settings, etc.

saved_models/: This directory is used to store saved trained models.

requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

README.md: Project documentation, providing an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and usage.

main.py: Main script that orchestrates the entire machine learning pipeline.

app/: This directory is optional and could contain files related to deploying the model, such as a Flask app, API scripts, etc.
